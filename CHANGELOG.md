## [0.24.0] 2025-04-08

### Added
- Web UI is now available at localhost:1818 when ra-aid is started with `--server`
- Session status tracking (pending, running, completed, failed) in the database and API.
- Robust WebSocket connection handling in the frontend with auto-reconnect and heartbeats (`frontend/common/src/websocket/connection.ts`).
- Serve prebuilt web UI static files directly from the backend server (`ra_aid/server/server.py`, `ra_aid/server/prebuilt/`).
- `broadcast_sender.py` module for decoupled WebSocket message broadcasting via a queue (`ra_aid/server/broadcast_sender.py`).
- `SessionNotFoundError` custom exception (`ra_aid/exceptions.py`).
- `build:prebuilt` npm script to build frontend assets into the backend distribution (`frontend/package.json`).

### Changed
- Refactored backend WebSocket broadcasting to use the new `broadcast_sender` queue, improving reliability and decoupling (`ra_aid/server/server.py`, `ra_aid/server/api_v1_spawn_agent.py`).
- Updated various frontend components and stores to integrate with the new WebSocket logic and session status (`frontend/common/`).
- Enhanced logging in `ra_aid/agents/research_agent.py` with thread IDs.

### Fixed
- Resolved WebSocket message serialization error for `session_update` payloads by ensuring proper JSON serialization (`mode='json'`) before queuing messages in the new broadcast sender mechanism (`ra_aid/server/api_v1_spawn_agent.py`, `ra_aid/server/broadcast_sender.py`).

### Build
- Added script (`frontend/package.json#build:prebuilt`) to build and copy frontend assets to `ra_aid/server/prebuilt/` for server distribution.

### Internal
- Added database migration for the new session `status` field (`ra_aid/migrations/015_20250408_140800_add_session_status.py`).
- Updated `.gitignore`.


# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.23.0] 2025-04-07

### Added
- Added configuration parameters for the `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25` model (`ra_aid/models_params.py`).

### Changed
- Updated default provider logic in `ra_aid/__main__.py` to prioritize the Gemini provider (`gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25` model) if the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable is set. The previous OpenAI/Anthropic logic serves as a fallback.
- Updated default *expert* provider logic in `ra_aid/__main__.py` to prioritize Gemini (`gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25` model) if `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set, before falling back to OpenAI or DeepSeek.

### Fixed
- Improved robustness of triple-quoted string handling in tool calls generated by the CIAYN agent, particularly for `put_complete_file_contents`, ensuring the fix is applied only when necessary (`ra_aid/agent_backends/ciayn_agent.py`).

## [0.22.0] 2025-04-03

### Added

- Support for Anthropic\'s `claude-3.7` series models (`ra_aid/models_params.py`, `tests/ra_aid/test_anthropic_token_limiter.py`).
- Support for Fireworks AI provider and models (`fireworks/firefunction-v2`, `fireworks/dbrx-instruct`) (`ra_aid/models_params.py`, `ra_aid/llm.py`).
- Implicit think tag detection: `process_thinking_content` now checks for `<think>` tags even if `supports_think_tag` is not explicitly `True` in model config, provided it\'s not `False` and the content starts with the tag (`ra_aid/text/processing.py`, `tests/ra_aid/text/test_process_thinking.py`).
- Command-line arguments `--project-dir` and `--db-path` added to `ra-aid usage latest` and `ra-aid usage all` subcommands for specifying database location (`ra_aid/scripts/cli.py`, `ra_aid/scripts/all_sessions_usage.py`, `ra_aid/scripts/last_session_usage.py`).
- Reinitialization capability for Singleton classes via `_initialize` method (`ra_aid/utils/singleton.py`).
- Metadata tracking (`model_name`, `provider`) added during LLM initialization (`ra_aid/llm.py`, `tests/ra_aid/test_llm.py`).

### Changed

- **Refactored Callback Handling:** Replaced `AnthropicCallbackHandler` with a generalized `DefaultCallbackHandler` located in `ra_aid/callbacks/default_callback_handler.py`. This new handler supports multiple providers, improves cost/token tracking logic, standardizes initialization, enhances database interaction for trajectory logging, and provides better context management (`ra_aid/callbacks/default_callback_handler.py`, `ra_aid/agent_utils.py`, `ra_aid/console/output.py`, `tests/ra_aid/callbacks/test_default_callback_handler.py`, `tests/ra_aid/test_token_usage_tracking.py`).
- **Refactored Thinking Processing:** Significantly updated `process_thinking_content` in `ra_aid/text/processing.py` for clearer logic flow. It now explicitly handles structured thinking (list format) separately from string-based `<think>` tag extraction. The logic for tag extraction now depends on the `supports_think_tag` configuration value (True: always check, False: never check, None: check only if content starts with `<think>`) (`ra_aid/text/processing.py`, `tests/ra_aid/text/test_process_thinking.py`, `tests/ra_aid/agent_backends/test_ciayn_agent_think_tag.py`).
- **Refactored Token Limiting:** Renamed `sonnet_35_state_modifier` to `base_state_modifier` in `ra_aid/anthropic_token_limiter.py` for broader applicability and adjusted associated logic (`ra_aid/anthropic_token_limiter.py`, `ra_aid/agent_utils.py`, `tests/ra_aid/test_anthropic_token_limiter.py`).
- Updated LLM initialization (`initialize_llm` in `ra_aid/llm.py`) to include provider/model metadata and refine DeepSeek provider logic for different DeepSeek models (`ra_aid/llm.py`, `tests/ra_aid/test_llm.py`).
- Improved rate limit error handling and retry logic in `_handle_api_error` (`ra_aid/agent_utils.py`).
- Removed redundant console output from `ripgrep_search` tool; results are now only in the returned dictionary (`ra_aid/tools/ripgrep.py`).
- Updated numerous unit tests across the codebase to reflect the extensive refactoring in callbacks, thinking processing, token limiting, and LLM initialization.
- Updated project dependencies as recorded in `uv.lock` and `pyproject.toml`.

### Fixed

- Corrected an import path typo in `ra_aid/dependencies.py`.
- Ensured the correct callback handler instance (`DefaultCallbackHandler`) is used for fetching cost information for display (`ra_aid/console/output.py`).
- Addressed various test failures arising from the refactoring of core components.

### Removed

- Removed the dedicated `ra_aid/callbacks/anthropic_callback_handler.py` file. Its functionality has been merged and generalized into `ra_aid/callbacks/default_callback_handler.py`.
